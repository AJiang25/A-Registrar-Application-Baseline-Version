Amanda: I did the args parse logic in both regoverviews.py and regdetails.py. 
I also figured out and implemented the condition array and descriptor array 
logic for dept, num, area, and title to join multiple AND statements and 
prevent sql injection attacks. I handled the escape edge case in those four 
categories as well. I also did half of the sql statements for regdetails.py. 
Finally, I wrote the testregovervews.py and testregdetails.py.

Arnold: I wrote the sql statement for regoverviews.py and half of the sql 
statements for regdetails.py. I wrote the helper function for the textwrap. 
I also figured out all of the exception cases for both regoverviews.py and 
regdetails.py. I also figured out how to connect to the sql database through 
cursor. Finally, I wrote out the formatting and print statements for 
regdetails.py.

Learnings:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The assignment helped us gain a better understanding of SQL and 
how to use those commands, and it was also good refresher on python. 
Also, we learned more about how to properly throw exceptions. This 
was our first time using prepared statements in python. Although,
we had experience using prepared statements in PHP, we had never
encountered it in python, so this was a unique experience to do so.
